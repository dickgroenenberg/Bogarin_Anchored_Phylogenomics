# Bogarin_Anchored_Phylogenomics
A number of single purpose scripts used to analyse the dataset of Bogarin et al. 2018 (in prep)

### Project outline
A dataset consisting of 446 **_fasta_** files (markers) containing 32 reads (taxa) each needed to be Blasted against [GenBank][nBlast]. The data was not Blasted locally against a subset of GenBank (which would significantly speed up the analysis) because the targeted genes were unknown and source DNA had to be validated (in order to rule out contamination). [Blastn 2.6.0][BlastCmndline] was used to facilitate Blast searches from the command line. For each of the 14,472 (theoretical) searches the sequence header (fasta) along with the top five best matching records had to be extracted.

The second part of the project was to adjust the header for each of the reads in the fasta files for submission to GenBank supposedly using tbl2asn2.

Issues encountered:  
 * empty reads for some of the sequences
 * issues with SED on OSX (temporarily solved by using GSED, but unneccary under Unix)
